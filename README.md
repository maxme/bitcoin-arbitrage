Note, this example is real, it has happened when the blockchain
forked. MtGox is a very reactive market, price dropped significally in
1 hour, this kind of situation opens very good arbitrage
opportunities with slower exchanges.

# TODO

 * Tests
 * Add other exchanges:
   * icbit
 * Update order books with a WebSocket client for supported exchanges (MtGox, Bitcoin-Central)
 * Better documentation
 * Add fiat currency converters USD / EUR
 * Replace float by Decimal
 * Better history handling for observer "HistoryDumper" (Redis ?)
 * Move EUR / USD from a market to an other:
   * Coupons
   * Ripple ?
   * Negative Operations
