# WARNING

**Real trading bots are included. Don't put your API keys in config.py
  if you don't know what you are doing.**

# Configuration

    cp arbitrage/config.py-example arbitrage/config.py

Then edit config.py file to setup your preferences: watched markets
and observers


# Run

You need Python3 to run this program.

To install on Debian, Ubuntu, or variants of them, use:

    $ apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    
**NOTE**: We are assuming proper permissions. If it asks if you are root, run it again with "sudo" at the beginning.

To use the observer:
XMPPMessager you will need to install sleekxmpp:

    $ pip3 install sleekxmpp
    
**NOTE**: Again, if you see some output telling you "permission denied", add "sudo" to the beginning to give pip3 root privileges.

## To run the opportunity watcher:

    $ python3 arbitrage/arbitrage.py
    2013-03-12 03:52:14,341 [INFO] profit: 30.539722 EUR with volume: 10 BTC - buy at 29.3410 (MtGoxEUR) sell at 29.4670 (Bitcoin24EUR) ~10.41%
    2013-03-12 03:52:14,356 [INFO] profit: 66.283642 EUR with volume: 10 BTC - buy at 29.3410 (MtGoxEUR) sell at 30.0000 (BitcoinCentralEUR) ~22.59%
    2013-03-12 03:52:14,357 [INFO] profit: 31.811390 EUR with volume: 10 BTC - buy at 29.3410 (MtGoxEUR) sell at 30.0000 (IntersangoEUR) ~10.84%
    2013-03-12 03:52:45,090 [INFO] profit: 9.774324 EUR with volume: 10 BTC - buy at 35.3630 (Bitcoin24EUR) sell at 35.4300 (BitcoinCentralEUR) ~2.76%

Note, this example is real, it has happened when the blockchain
forked. MtGox is a very reactive market, price dropped significally in
1 hour, this kind of situation opens very good arbitrage
opportunities with slower exchanges.

## To check you balance on an exchange:

    $ python3 arbitrage/arbitrage.py get-balance

# Run tests

    $ nosetests arbitrage/

# TODO

 * Tests
 * Write documentation
 * Add other exchanges:
   * icbit
 * Update order books with a WebSocket client for supported exchanges
   (MtGox, Bitcoin-Central)
 * Add fiat currency converters USD / EUR that permits mixing currencies
 * Replace float by Decimal
 * Better history handling for observer "HistoryDumper" (Redis ?)
 * Move EUR / USD from a market to an other:
   * Coupons
   * Ripple ?
   * Negative Operations
   * use Litecoin or other cryptocurrencies trades
