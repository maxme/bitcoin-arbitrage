variants of them, use:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip

To use the observer XMPPMessager you will need to install sleekxmpp:

    2013-03-12 03:52:14,341 [INFO] profit: 30.539722 EUR with volume: 10 BTC - buy at 29.3410 (MtGoxEUR) sell at 29.4670 (Bitcoin24EUR) ~10.41%

    2013-03-12 03:52:14,357 [INFO] profit: 31.811390 EUR with volume: 10 BTC - buy at 29.3410 (MtGoxEUR) sell at 30.0000 (IntersangoEUR) ~10.84%

Note, this example is real, it has happened when the blockchain
forked. MtGox is a very reactive market, price dropped significally in
1 hour, this kind of situation opens very good arbitrage
opportunities with slower exchanges.

To check your balance on an exchange (also a good way to check your accounts configuration):

    $ python3 arbitrage.py -m MtGoxEUR get-balance
    $ python3 arbitrage.py -m MtGoxEUR,MtGoxUSD,BitstampUSD get-balance

Run tests

    $ nosetests arbitrage/

# TODO

 * Tests
 * Write documentation
 * Add other exchanges:
   * icbit
 * Update order books with a WebSocket client for supported exchanges
   (MtGox, Bitcoin-Central, Ripple, Bitstamp?)
 * Better history handling for observer "HistoryDumper" (Redis ?)
 * handle fees properly
 * Move EUR / USD from a market to an other:
   * Coupons
   * Negative Operations
   * use Litecoin or other cryptocurrencies trades
